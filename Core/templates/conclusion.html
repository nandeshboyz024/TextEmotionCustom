    <div style="font-family:Helvetica Neue;text-align:justify;font-size:20px;">
        <p>Now, let's talk about bias. Bias is like if one group of friends has more of a specific type of toy than the other group. It's not necessarily wrong, but we need to be aware of it.</p>
        <p>In our toy world, What will happen when a child sees toys around them and among their friends? If toys are in a biased condition, he will also choose toys from the same category if he doesn't know what kind of toy he likes or wants to play.</p>
        <p>In the same way, If computer could not get exact feelings from the given text, it moves towards bias prediction. As you can see from dataset-1 and dataset-2 that dataset-1 is bias towards joy and sadness emotion.</p>
